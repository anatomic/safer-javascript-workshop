# Exercise 3 - Creating A Functional Pipeline


## Setup

To work with this exercise you will need to install the dependencies and use a version of node > 8.

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

## Working through the exercise

It is recommended to work through the tests from top to bottom. Initially, all but the first test are skipped, allowing you to build up the functionality required in a step by step fashion.

## Extension Tasks

At the end of the test suite are two additional tests which add in some challenges around handling invalid input (i.e. missing data or the wrong type of data). If you have a chance, see if you can amend your code to ensure all these edge cases are covered.
