# Exercise 4 - Creating Something Useful

Using the [CityBikes API](http://api.citybik.es/v2/):
1. Get all networks and filter down to just those in GB
2. Get all stations for each of the GB networks
3. Sum the number of free_bikes for each network
4. Output a list sorted by number of free bikes

## Setup

The `package.json` file contains the same basic dependencies as the rest of the exercises and a couple of tests to check your answer against. The tests are less extensive and only really offer a guide to what the overall output should be. This exercise is an opportunity to try different things and get your hands dirty working with ADTs.

There is a public gist of *one* approach to solving this, if you're really stuck get in touch with me and I'll share the link (unless you're a decent sleuth and have found it for yourself).

## Extension Tasks

If you've successfully completed the above, why not have a go at providing a version which lists the free bikes and empty slots for each station in London?
