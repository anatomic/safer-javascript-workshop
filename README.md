## Reference Errors

> The `ReferenceError` object represents an error when a non-existent variable is referenced.

## Type Errors

> The `TypeError` object represents an error when a value is not of the expected type.

Typical errors:

> `undefined` is not a function
> TypeError: cannot read property `x` of `undefined`
